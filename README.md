A to do list app with points to get more things done.

# Thinking through the Taxonomy of Tasks

- Can be recurring or not
- Can be persistent or not (e.g. if you don't get it done it stays, or you have one chance and it drops)
- Can be part of a project or a set of tasks (e.g. "run the checklist" concept)
- Can be part of an area or category (e.g. work, health, logistics)
- Can be completed, archived, paused, or deleted
- Can be associated with a time of day, or maybe even a place
- Take an amount of time to complete
- Can be a part of a daily, weekly, monthly streak
- Can be a part of contingent checklist
- Can be sequential or all at once (e.g. does the next task appear at the same time as previous, or only after the previous one is compelted / deleted / archived, or with some waiting period?


## Examples:
- Morning routine
- Air BNB checklist
- MBR
- Strategy Project at work
- Jill answering slack messages
- Start work routine
- Every two weeks get paid routine
- Invest in a stock routine
- Listen to earnings call routine
